## Cinematt
This website contains select images from my archive of over 60,000 photographs taken from 2004 to the present day. 

If I could describe the type of photographer I am, I would say I am enthusiast who keeps at it - constantly taking the camera out, experimenting, reading, learning and producing.

I don't do this in any professional capacity - mainly an expensive hobby. I take my camera with me wherever I go because there is always something interesting happening. The trick is to keep going out and keep shooting.

## Motivation
I wanted to build something so I could show the world my photography. I wanted to show my work on my terms in a setting I feel comfortable with - something I have built myself.

I am also a freelance software engineer and I built this website to learn the CSS Grid layout engine, which is excellent for art direction.

## Me
I am from Dublin in Ireland and have been living in Berlin for the last four years. Photography has been a passion of mine for the last fifteen years.

## Gear
I shoot on a *Nikon D800* and I have the *Nikon 16mm f2.8 fisheye*, *Nikon 24&ndash;70 f2.8* and *Nikkor 50mm f1.4* lenses. 

I use Adobe Photoshop with Camera Raw to process the images. HDR photos are treated using Photomatix HDR Pro.

## Terms
I respect you and your privacy as a visitor to my site. This is why I don't have any third party tracking scripts installed.

If you want to use any of my pictures then please feel free to get in touch. I am a reasonable man and amenable to requests thereof.

If you use any of these pictures and display them in a for-profit publication without my permission, the automatic daily rate for their use is &euro;1,000 per day for each copy disseminated. 

By visiting this site, you are automatically agreeing to these terms.
